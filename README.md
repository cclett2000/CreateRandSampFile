# CreateRandSampFile
Little program that generates a text file with random numbers. I was really tired of typing random numbers for class so here is my solution!

# NOTICE: this will work only if you are using an IDE on your local system, meaning that online IDE's such as JDoodle will not work (as far as I know)
- I recommend IntelliJ IDEA if you need an IDE (Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

# Instructions
- First open the 'src' folder and then open 'CreateFile.java' (on GitHub)
- I recommend copying and pasting the code into your IDE, however, you can download either the file or the entire repository
  - I could be wrong about the repository (still new to GitHub)
- Build/Run the .java file in your IDE after setting the location for file creation
  - code comments should help you out here
  - you will be prompted to enter the number of values required for your assignment/project after successfully running the program, which will specify how many random numbers will be in the file created.
- Finally open the created file and verify that it was generated successfully
  - file should have a positive integer number on every line
